# ICPUNO

ICPUNO is a decentralized, multiplayer UNO card game built on the Internet Computer (ICP), featuring a Rust-based backend and a modern frontend using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. With Internet Identity for secure authentication, ICPUNO provides a seamless, decentralized gaming experience entirely hosted on ICP.

## Overview

ICPUNO brings the classic UNO card game to the decentralized web, utilizing the Internet Computer (ICP) for both backend and frontend components. This setup ensures high performance, scalability, and a user-friendly interface. Authentication is managed through Internet Identity, enabling secure, password-free login. 

### Key Technologies
- **Backend**: Rust for high performance and reliability.
- **Frontend**: Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI.
- **Authentication**: Internet Identity, providing secure, decentralized login.

## Technical Breakdown

### Contracts

Game logic for card dealing, turn management, and action validation is handled through canisters written in Rust on ICP blockchain. Key aspects of this setup include:

- **Publicly Verifiable**: All moves are visible on-chain, allowing players to verify game integrity.
- **Immutable**: Game rules are tamper-proof once deployed.
- **Secure**: Cryptographic security ensures each move and game state update is protected.

### Game State Management

The game's state (player turns, remaining cards, state transitions) is fully managed on-chain, ensuring:
- **Consistency**: Synchronized updates across all players.
- **Transparency**: Real-time game progress visibility via blockchain queries.
- **Reliability**: Decentralized management with no single point of failure.

### Action Validation and Commit-Reveal Mechanism

To maintain fairness, critical actions (e.g., playing a card) follow a commit-reveal process:
1. **Commit Phase**: Players submit a hashed version of their move, concealing it from others.
2. **Reveal Phase**: After all players commit, they reveal their actions, verified against the original hashes.

This ensures no player can change their move based on others' actions, upholding fairness.

### Privacy Layer

Sensitive information like player hands and deck state is protected through encryption:
- **Encryption**: Only relevant players can view their private data.
- **Privacy-Preserving Elements**: Sensitive information is managed off-chain while maintaining game integrity with cryptographic proofs.

### Deck Shuffling and Cryptographic Operations

Deck handling relies on cryptographic operations to ensure fairness and randomness:
- **Deck Shuffling**: Cryptographic algorithms guarantee a fair shuffle.
- **Card Draws**: Drawn cards are individually decrypted for players, keeping remaining cards secure.

### State Reconstruction and Verification

Private elements (like player hands) remain hidden, but the overall game state is verifiable through:
- **Cryptographic Commitments**: Game state is reconstructed via commitments, letting players verify moves without exposing sensitive data.
- **Fairness Assurance**: This system prevents cheating while safeguarding player privacy.

### Frontend

The frontend employs an optimistic rollup architecture for efficiency:
- **Chain Interaction**: The Game UI batches on-chain transactions, periodically sending them to enhance performance.
- **Optimistic Rollup Approach**: This design speeds up game actions and improves transaction efficiency.

## Why ICP for a Card Game like UNO?

ICP provides an ideal platform for ICPUNO due to its unique features:
- **Scalability**: ICPâ€™s canister model allows for scalable state management and concurrent game handling.
- **Security**: Native authentication and decentralized structure offer enhanced privacy.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Hosting frontend and backend on ICP reduces server costs.
- **Developer Experience**: ICP supports complex logic development, such as card shuffling and state synchronization, with tools like Rust.

## Benefits to the ICP Ecosystem

ICPUNO highlights the potential of the Internet Computer as a gaming platform:
- **Demonstrates Flexibility**: Building a game like UNO illustrates ICP's versatility beyond traditional web apps.
- **Showcases Decentralized Gaming**: A model for developing decentralized games with optimal performance and user experience.
- **Encourages Adoption**: Familiar games like UNO can introduce users to the advantages of the ICP ecosystem.
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Showcases ICPâ€™s strengths for complex applications, encouraging innovation in decentralized gaming.

## Roadmap

- **Integrate Websockets Canister**: Enhance real-time gameplay with WebSocket support.
- **Improve Transaction Rollup Adherence**: Refine transaction efficiency and bundling.
- **Implement Dispute Resolution**: Add mechanisms for handling disputes.
- **Integrate ICP Tokens**: Introduce ICP token functionality for in-game transactions.
- **Build a Leaderboard**: Track player progress and top scores.
